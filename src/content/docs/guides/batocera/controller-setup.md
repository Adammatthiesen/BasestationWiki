Any generic USB controller should work. There is no special action to do to make it work, except to map it (if it is not in the database already).

Any generic Bluetooth controller should work. The only action to do is to set your controller in discovery mode (there is usually a special button combination you need to hold for a few seconds, refer to its manual) then pair the controller by going in the menu to `MAIN MENU` → `CONTROLLER & BLUETOOTH SETTINGS` → `PAIR A BLUETOOTH DEVICE`. There is no special action to do to make it work, except to map it (if it is not in the database already).

In case of pairing issues it may help to clear the device from the list by selecting `FORGET BLUETOOTH DEVICES`, reboot and then try to pair again.
