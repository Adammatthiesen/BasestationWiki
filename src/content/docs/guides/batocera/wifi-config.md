Ethernet connects and configures itself automatically, but this is not so the case for Wi-Fi. Some manual action is required.

First, activate Wi-Fi in the first place by going to the `MAIN MENU` → `NETWORK SETTINGS` → `ENABLE WIFI`

Wait a moment for the Wi-Fi chip to actually turn on and start scanning (some devices may require a full reboot). Then all the available Wi-Fi access points will appear in the list.
